Math/LaTeX rendering will be disabled.
If you have administrative access to the notebook server and a working internet connection, you can install a local copy of MathJax for offline use with the following command on the server at a Python or IPython prompt:
>>> from IPython.external import mathjax; mathjax.install_mathjax()
This will try to install MathJax into the IPython source directory.
If IPython is installed to a location that requires administrative privileges to write, you will need to make this call as an administrator, via 'sudo'.
When you start the notebook server, you can instruct it to disable MathJax support altogether:
$ ipython notebook --no-mathjax
which will prevent this dialog from appearing.
