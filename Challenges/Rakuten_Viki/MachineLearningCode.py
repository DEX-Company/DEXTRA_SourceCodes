	This function will run some check on the data; personally, I prefer: 
	1st. check the data on Excel to gain an overview of the whole data;
	2nd. run a deep check on python, to find more information on the data, such as # of rows, # of unique values in each column, 
	some statistic distribution figures
	3rd. run some algorithm to see how the results are
